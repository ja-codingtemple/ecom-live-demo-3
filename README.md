# Advanced JS & Intro to React (Starter Code)

There are three components that make this application work:
- App.jsx
- ProductList.jsx
- ProductItem.jsx

In App.jsx we are creating an array of products and storing it via the useState hook. We are then passing that array of products to our ProductList component, which we are rendering once.
In our ProductList component we are using JavaScript's map() function to access each item in our list of products one at a time, and for each product we're rendering a ProductItem component.
As we render the ProductItem component, we pass each individual product to it. Inside of ProductItem we render each product's individual properties: Name, price, description.
